# Description of your game
The game Save the Princess was created using the C++ programming language. We implemented a word search in this game. Basically, this game is about rescuing a princess. To save the princess, you must navigate through three kingdoms which are the Kingdom of Food, the Kingdom of Country, and the Kingdom of Celebrations. The word search is carefully design to each kingdom's theme, drawing players into an immersive experience. For example, in Food Kingdom, players may encounter word searches containing food-related words such as "apples", "pizza", and "rice". In each kingdom there are 5-word search and must search for a word in each word search. Upon reaching the first kingdom, the Food Kingdom, a 10x10 grid of letters will appear and the player must find the hidden words. This process is repeated for each kingdom. The player has two options. They can guess the word directly or get a hint first and then guess the word. When the players guessed the word correctly, they will obtain scores. The player must obtain a minimum of 10 points by correctly guessing the words in the word searches in order to win the game and save the princess.//CAN ADD BONUS PART HERE IF GOT
